## Plane geometry

### Exercise 1

Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in a plane. Assume that no three points of $P$ are collinear. Describe an algorithm which constructs a polygon with $P$ as its vertex set in $O(n \log n)$ time.

Find an unbounded family $\mathcal{P}$ of sets of points in a plane (i.e, for any natural number $n$ there exists $P \in \mathcal{P}$ with $\vert P \vert \ge n$) with the property that for any $P \in \mathcal{P}$, there are exponentially many polygons with $P$ as their vertex set. That is, there exists a number $\epsilon > 0$ such that for each $P \in \mathcal{P}$ there exist at least $(1 + \epsilon)^{\vert P \vert}$ polygons with $P$ as their vertex set.

### Exercise 2

We are given the sets $R$ and $B$ of red and blue points, respectively. Assume that $R \cap B = \emptyset$ and that no three points are collinear. A matching $M \subset R \times B$ between $R$ and $B$ is a *disjoint matching* if the segments $\overline{rb}$ (where $(r, b) \in M$) are pairwise disjoint.

1. Let $M^\ast$ be the shortest matching between $R$ and $B$ (i.e., the sum of the lengths of the segments is minimal). Prove that $M^\ast$ is a disjoint matching.
2. Can we use 1. for an algorithm which finds a disjoint matching?

### Exercise 3

We are given a set $P$ of $n$ points and a line $\ell$ in a plane. We are looking for the smallest disk ${D_{\min}}$ with its center on the line $\ell$ containing all points of $P$. Describe an algorithm which finds ${D_{\min}}$ in polynomial time. ($O(n \log n)$ is possible, but too hard for now.)

### Exercise 4

Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in a plane, and let $L$ be the set of lines passing through each pair of points of $P$. Describe an algorithm which finds the line in $L$ with the largest slope in $o(n^2)$ time.
