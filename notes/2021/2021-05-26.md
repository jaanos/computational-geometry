## Range trees

### Exercise 1

We are given a set $P$ of $n$ points in a plane. We want to design a dynamic data structure which stores a subset $Q \subseteq P$. At the beginning, we have $Q = P$. The data structure should be able to perform the following operations in $O(\log^2 n)$ time:

* Deleting a point $p \in Q$ from $Q$.
* Inserting a point $p \in P \setminus Q$ into $Q$,
* Counting $\vert Q \cap R \vert$ for a query rectangle $R$.

### Exercise 2

We are given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is constant. We want to design a data structure which stores $P$ and allows _partial queries_. A partial query is given by values for a subset of coordinates, and its result is the set of points which match the given coordinates.

1. Explain how to perform partial queries in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with a $2$-dimensional range tree. What is the time complexity of the query?
2. Describe a data structure with linear space complexity which can perform partial queries in $O(\log n + k)$ time. Keep in mind that we may use $O(d 2^d n)$ space, where $d$ is constant.

### Exercise 3

Let $H$ be a set of at most $n$ horizontal segments and let $V$ be a set of at most $n$ vertical segments. We want to find an algorithm which determines the number of intersecting pairs from $H \times V$ in $O(n \log n)$ time.

1. Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}$. Describe a dynamic data structure which stores a subset $Q\subseteq P$ and can perform the following operations in $O(\log n)$ time: adding an element of $P \setminus Q$, deleting an element from $Q$, and counting points $Q \cap I$ for a given interval $I$.
2. Describe an algorithm which determines the number of intersecting pairs from $H \times V$ in $O(n \log n)$ time.
