## Range trees

```python
class AssociatedTree:
    def __init__(self, ordered, dim, dims):
        points = ordered[dim]
        n = len(points)
        h = (n-1) // 2
        self.split = points[h][dim]
        self.dim = dim
        self.left = self.right = self.assoc = self.point = None
        self.next = self.first = self.last = None
        if n > 1:
            left = [[p for p in pts if p[dim] <= self.split] for pts in ordered]
            right = [[p for p in pts if p[dim] > self.split] for pts in ordered]
            self.left = AssociatedTree(left, dim, dims)
            self.first = self.left.first
            self.right = AssociatedTree(right, dim, dims)
            self.last = self.right.last
            self.left.last.next = self.right.first
        else:
            self.point, = points
            self.first = self.last = self
        if dim < dims - 1:
            self.assoc = AssociatedTree(ordered, dim+1, dims)

    def query(self, left, right):
        if self.point is not None:
            if left[self.dim] <= self.split <= right[self.dim]:
                yield from self.report(left, right)
            return
        elif right[self.dim] <= self.split:
            yield from self.left.query(left, right)
        elif left[self.dim] > self.split:
            yield from self.right.query(left, right)
        else:
            yield from self.left.left_descent(left, right)
            yield from self.right.right_descent(left, right)

    def left_descent(self, left, right):

        if left[self.dim] > self.split:

        else:    
            yield from self.left.left_descent(left, right)
            yield from self.right.report(left, right)
            
    def right_descent(self, left, right):
        if self.point is not None:
            if right[self.dim] >= self.split:
                yield from self.report(left, right)
            return
        if right[self.dim] <= self.split:
            yield from self.left.right_descent(left, right)
        else:    
            yield from self.left.report(left, right)
            yield from self.right.right_descent(left, right)

    def report(self, left, right):
        if self.assoc is not None:
            yield from self.assoc.query(left, right)
        else:
            p = self.first
            while p != self.last:
                yield p.point
                p = p.next
            yield p.point

class RangeTree:
    def __init__(self, points, dims):
        assert len(points) > 0
        ordered = [sorted(points, key=lambda p, i=i: p[i]) for i in range(dims)]
        self.tree = AssociatedTree(ordered, 0, dims)

* Space complexity: $O(n \log^{d-1} n)$
* Construction: $O(n \log^{d-1} n)$
* Query: $O(\log^d n + k)$, where $k$ is the number of reported points

### Exercise 1

We are given a set $P$ of $n$ points in a plane. We want to design a dynamic data structure which stores a subset $Q \subseteq P$. At the beginning, we have $Q = P$. The data structure should be able to perform the following operations in $O(\log^2 n)$ time:

* Deleting a point $p \in Q$ from $Q$.
* Inserting a point $p \in P \setminus Q$ into $Q$,
* Counting $\vert Q \cap R \vert$ for a query rectangle $R$.

----

* At each node $u$ of the last level tree, store the number of points in $Q$ in the leaves of the subtree rooted in $u$.
* Deleting $p$:
  - Find $p$ in the main tree, and ascend to the root and fix every associated tree of the nodes in the path
  - Fixing: find $p$ in the associated tree, and ascend to its root, decreasing counts at each nod in the path
* Inserting $p$:
  - Find $p$ in the main tree, and ascend to the root and fix every associated tree of the nodes in the path
  - Fixing: find $p$ in the associated tree, and ascend to its root, increasing counts at each nod in the path
* Counting query:
  - Similar to a normal query, but instead of reporting points we return the stored counts and sum them up

### Exercise 2

We are given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is constant. We want to design a data structure which stores $P$ and allows _partial queries_. A partial query is given by values for a subset of coordinates, and its result is the set of points which match the given coordinates.

1. Explain how to perform partial queries in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with a $2$-dimensional range tree. What is the time complexity of the query?
2. Describe a data structure with linear space complexity which can perform partial queries in $O(\log n + k)$ time. Keep in mind that we may use $O(d 2^d n)$ space, where $d$ is constant.

----

Example partial queries in $\mathbb{R}^3$:

* find all points with $x = 1, y = 2$
* find all points with $y = 2, z = -1$
* find all points with $y = 2$
* find all points with $x = 1, y = 2, z = 3$

1. ```python
   inf = float('inf')

   def partial_query(tree, x=None, y=None):
       if x is None:
           xmin = -inf
           xmax = inf
       else:
           xmin = xmax = x
       if y is None:
           ymin = -inf
           ymax = inf
       else:
           ymin = ymax = y
       yield from tree.query(left=[xmin, ymin], right=[xmax, ymax])
   ```
   
   * Time complexity: $O(\log^2 n + k)$
   * Space complexity: $O(n \log n)$

2. Suppose we are given points $({x_1^{(i)}}, {x_2^{(i)}}, \dots, {x_d^{(i)}})$ ($1 \le i \le n$).

   * For every $I \subseteq \lbrace 1, 2, \dots, d \rbrace$, make an array by sorting lexicographically by $({x_j})_{j \in I}$
   * For a partial query giving values for coordinates of the dimensions in $I \subseteq \lbrace 1, 2, \dots, d \rbrace$, perform a bisection and then walk left and right to report all the points

### Exercise 3

Let $H$ be a set of at most $n$ horizontal segments and let $V$ be a set of at most $n$ vertical segments. We want to find an algorithm which determines the number of intersecting pairs from $H \times V$ in $O(n \log n)$ time.

1. Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}$. Describe a dynamic data structure which stores a subset $Q\subseteq P$ and can perform the following operations in $O(\log n)$ time: adding an element of $P \setminus Q$, deleting an element from $Q$, and counting points $Q \cap I$ for a given interval $I$.
2. Describe an algorithm which determines the number of intersecting pairs from $H \times V$ in $O(n \log n)$ time.
