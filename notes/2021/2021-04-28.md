## DCEL

### Exercise 1

We are given a DCEL of a connected subdivision in a plane. Each face of the subdivision, except for the outer face, is convex. Give an efficient pseudocode for the following tasks.

1. Given a face $f$, list the vertices of $f$.
2. Given a face $f$, determine whether $f$ is the outer face.
3. Given a vertex $v$, find the faces incident to $v$.
4. Given a vertex $v$, find the vertex of the DCEL with the smallest $x$-coordinate.
5. Given a face $f$, list the faces with at least one vertex in common with $f$.
6. Given a line $\overline{pq}$ intersecting the edges of the DCEL (but not its vertices) and a face $f$ containing $p$, update the DCEL to represent a new subdivision which includes $\overline{pq}$.

### Exercise 2

We are given a DCEL representing a subdivision of the plane and a face $f$ of this subdivision. Assume that each face of the subdivision is defined by a cycle of edges without repetitions. We want to delete all edges incident to $f$, i.e., we delete the edges from the set $D = \lbrace e \mid e \text{ is an edge of } f \rbrace$. Assume that the subdivision remains connected after $D$ is deleted. Write the pseudocode for deleting the edges of $D$ and updates the DCEL. What is the time complexity of the algorithm?

## Arrangements

### Exercise 3

Let $H$ be a set of $n$ lines in the plane which intersect in the same point $p$, and let $H'$ be a set of $m$ lines in the plane which intersect in another point $p' \ne p$. The lines of $H$ do not contain $p'$ and the lines of $H'$ do not contain $p$.

1. How many vertices, edges and faces does the arrangement $\mathcal{A}(H)$ have?
2. How many vertices, edges and faces does the arrangement $\mathcal{A}(H \cup H')$ have?
3. Let $R$ be a set of $n$ planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Each plane of $R$ contains the point $(0, 0, 0)$, and no triple of planes intersects in a line. How many vertices, edges, faces and cells does the arrangement $\mathcal{A}(R)$ have?

### Exercise 4

Let ${L_h}$ and ${L_v}$ be sets of $n$ horizontal lines and $n$ vertical lines in a plane, respectively. Let ${L_p}$ be a set of $n$ lines in a plane intersecting in a point $p$. No line of ${L_p}$ is horizontal or vertical and no line from ${L_h}$ or ${L_v}$ contains the point $p$. Furthermore, no three lines ${\ell_h} \in {L_h}, {\ell_v} \in {L_v}, {\ell_p} \in {L_p}$ intersect in the same point.

1. How many vertices, edges and faces does the arrangement $\mathcal{A}({L_h} \cup {L_v} \cup L_p)$ have?
2. Describe the points dual to ${L_h} \cup {L_p}$.
