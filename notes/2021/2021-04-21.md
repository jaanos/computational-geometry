## Convexity

### Exercise 1

Describe a data structure for storing a convex polygon $P$ which allows us to find out in $O(\log n)$ time whether a query point is contained in $P$. The data structure should be constructed in linear time.

---

### Exercise 2

We are given two convex polygons $P, Q$. Describe a linear time algorithm which computes $\operatorname{CH}(P \cup Q)$. You may assume that $P$ and $Q$ are disjoint.

### Exercise 3

We are given a convex polygon $P$ as an array of vertices $p[1, \dots ,n]$.

1. Describe an $O(\log n)$ algorithm which finds the highest vertex of $P$.
2. Describe an $O(\log n)$ algorithm which finds both tangents of the polygon $P$ through a given point $p \in \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus P$.
3. Describe an $O(\log n)$ algorithm which finds the intersection of $P$ and a given line $\ell$.
4. Describe an $O(\log n)$ algorithm which finds the point of $P$ which is closest to the given line $\ell$.

## Arrangements

### Exercise 4

Let $H$ be a set of $n$ lines in the plane which intersect in the same point $p$, and let $H'$ be a set of $m$ lines in the plane which intersect in another point $p' \ne p$. The lines of $H$ do not contain $p'$ and the lines of $H'$ do not contain $p$.

1. How many vertices, edges and faces does the arrangement $\mathcal{A}(H)$ have?
2. How many vertices, edges and faces does the arrangement $\mathcal{A}(H \cup H')$ have?
3. Let $R$ be a set of $n$ planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Each plane of $R$ contains the point $(0, 0, 0)$, and no triple of planes intersects in a line. How many vertices, edges, faces and cells does the arrangement $\mathcal{A}(R)$ have?
