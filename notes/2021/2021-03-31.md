## Polygons

### Exercise 1

Draw the diagonals computed by the algorithm you have seen at the lectures
to the polygon in the figure below.

### Exercise 2

We are given a polygon with the following vertices:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p[0]  &= (a,4),& \;
p[1]  &= (6,0),& \;
p[2]  &= (3,0),& \;
p[3]  &= (2,9),& \\
p[4]  &= (4,6),& \;
p[5]  &= (7,5),& \;
p[6]  &= (10,5),& \;
p[7]  &= (13,6),& \\
p[8]  &= (14,10),& \;
p[9]  &= (15,0),& \;
p[10] &= (12,4),& \;
p[11] &= (8,0),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $a \in [5,11]$.

Triangulate the polygon using the algorithm from the lectures. Find $3$ values of the parameter $a$ (the vertices of the polygon should be in general position) for which the algorithms returns different triangulations. Note that the algorithm may compute the same trianguation in different ways. For the $3$ chosen values of $a$, draw three separate pictures showing the computed diagonals.

### Exercise 3

We are given a polygon as a list of vertices, but we do not know whether they are given in clockwise or counterclockwise order. Describe an algorithm which finds the order in linear time.

### Exercise 4

Write the pseudocode of an algorithm which computes a $3$-colouring of the given triangulation of a polygon in linear time.
