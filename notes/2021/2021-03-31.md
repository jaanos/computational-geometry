## Polygons

### Exercise 1

Draw the diagonals computed by the algorithm you have seen at the lectures
to the $x$-monotone polygon in the figure below.

### Exercise 2

We are given a polygon as a list of vertices, but we do not know whether they are given in clockwise or counterclockwise order. Describe an algorithm which finds the order in linear time.

----

* Find the leftmost point ${p_1}$.
* Let ${p_0}$ and ${p_2}$ be the predecessor and successor of ${p_1}$.
* If $({p_0}, {p_1}, {p_2})$ is a right turn, then we have clockwise order, otherwise we have counterclockwise order.

### Exercise 3

Describe an algorithm which, given a polygon $P$, finds a direction (if any) in which $P$ is monotone.

----

* For each concave vertex, determine the directions for which the vertex is a merge or split vertex.
  - between the lines perpendicular to the incident edges
* Sort the endpoints of the intervals by the angle.
* Count the number of vertices for which the initial angle is "forbidden" (i.e., we have a split or merge vertex).
* Walk through the endpoints and update the count.
* If at some point the counter drops to zero, then we have a direction for which $P$ is monotone.
* Time complexity: $O(n \log n)$

A linear time algorithm for this problem exists!

### Exercise 4

Write the pseudocode of an algorithm which computes a $3$-colouring of the given triangulation of a polygon in linear time.
