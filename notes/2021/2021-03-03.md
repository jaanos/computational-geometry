## Introduction

### Exercise 1

Let $T(1) = O(1)$. Prove:

1. If $T(n) = O(n) + 2T(n/2)$, then $T(n) = O(n \log n)$.
2. If $T(n) = O(n) + T(n/2)$, then $T(n) = O(n)$.

### Exercise 2

Describe an algorithm which, given a list of points ${p_1}, {p_2}, \dots, {p_n}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, deletes the repeated points, i.e., returns the set $\lbrace {p_1}, {p_2}, \dots, {p_n} \rbrace$. The time complexity should be $O(n \log n)$.

Describe the algorithm for the same problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$. What is its time complexity?

### Exercise 3

We are given $n$ segments in a plane. We know that the segments are the edges of a polygon, but they are not necessarily given in the "right" order. Describe an algorithm which reconstructs the polygon as a list of consecutive vertices in $O(n \log n)$ time.

### Exercise 4

For the points $p = ({p_x}, {p_y})$, $q = ({q_x}, {q_y})$ and $r = ({r_x}, {r_y})$ in a plane, we define

$$
D(p, q, r) = \begin{vmatrix}
1 & p_x & p_y \\
1 & q_x & q_y \\
1 & r_x & r_y
\end{vmatrix} .
$$

1. Prove that $D(p, q, r) > 0$ holds if and only if the sequence $p, q, r$ is a left turn.
2. Prove that $D(p, q, r) = 0$ holds if and only if the points $p, q, r$ are collinear.
3. Prove that $\vert D(p, q, r) \vert$ equals twice the area of the triangle $\triangle pqr$.

### Exercise 5

Describe an algorithm which computes the intersections of a given line with a given circle in a plane.

### Exercise 6

You are given a set $P$ of points in the plane. Find all collinear tuples of points in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.
