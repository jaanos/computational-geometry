## Sweeping algorithms

### Exercise 1

Let $S$ be a set of $n$ circles in a plane. (A circle is a curve, i.e., the edge of a disk.) Describe an output-sensitive sweeping algorithm which reports all intersections between the circles in $S$ in $O((n+k) \log n)$ time, where $k$ is the number of reported intersections.

* input: sequence of circles given by $(p, r)$, where $p$ is a point in the plane and $r > 0$
* output: sequence of points with pointers to intersecting circles

### Exercise 2

Let $P$ and $Q$ be $x$-monotonous paths with $n$ and $m$ vertices, respectively. Assume that no $3$ vertices are collinear.

1. Prove that $P \cap Q$ has cardinality at most $O(n+m)$.
2. Describe an algorithm which computes $P \cap Q$ in linear time.

### Exercise 3

Let $S$ be a set of $n$ pairwise disjoint segments in a plane, and let $p$ be a point not lying on any segment from $S$. Let $S(p)$ be the subset of the segments in $S$ which are partially visible from $p$ - i.e., a segment $s \in S$ is in $S(p)$ if and only if there is a point $q \in s$ such that $\overline{pq} \cap s' = \emptyset$ for each $s' \in S \setminus \lbrace s \rbrace$. Describe an algorithm which computes $S(p)$.

**Hint:** a sweeping algorithm can sweep with something which is not a line.

### Exercise 4

We are given a set $P$ of $n$ points in a plane, and two more points $q,q' \notin P$. We are looking for the disk ${D_\min}$ which contains $q, q'$ and the least number of points from $P$.

1. Prove: if there is a disk containing $q, q'$ and $k$ more points from $P$, then there exists a disk with $q, q'$ on its boundary which contains at most $k$ points of $P$.
2. For a given point $p$, let $C(p)$ be the set of centers of the disks containing $p$ with $q, q'$ on their boundary. What is $C(p)$?
3. Describe an algorithm which finds ${D_\min}$ in $O(n \log n)$ time.
