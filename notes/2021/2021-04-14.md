## Convexity

### Exercise 1

We are given a set of $10$ points ${\mathcal P} = \lbrace a, b, \dots, j \rbrace$. For the incremental algorithm and Graham's algorithm, specify the triples of points $(X, Y, Z) \in {\mathcal P}^3$ for which the algorithms checks whether the sequence $X,Y,Z$ is a right turn. The triples should be listed in the same order in which the algorithm considers them.

### Exercise 2

For a general $n$, describe a set $P$ of $n$ points in which at least one point occurs in $\Omega(n)$ triples when computing the convex hull of $P$ using the incremental algorithm.

### Exercise 3

Graham's algorithm consists of two steps:
(1) we first build a polygon $M$ from the given points, and then (2) we change $M$ until we get $\operatorname{CH}(P)$. Show that step (2) is not sufficient to compute the convex hull of a polygon: find a polygon $N$ such that immediately performing step (2) on it does not yield $\operatorname{CH}(N)$.

### Exercise 4

Let $P$ be a set of points in the plane. For each point $p \in P$ we define

$$
\operatorname{cell}(p)=\{ x\in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid d(x,p)\leq d(x,p') \text{ for each }p'\in P\},
$$

where $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ is the Euclidean distance. Show that $\operatorname{cell}(p)$ is a convex set for each point $p \in P$.

### Exercise 5

A convex polygon $M$ is given as a list of vertices in clockwise order. Describe a linear time algorithm which sorts the vertices of the polygon $M$ by their $x$ coordinates. Can your algorithm be adapted so that it will work for any polygon $M$ (still in linear time)?
