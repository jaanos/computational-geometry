## Duality

* $(O, x, y) \to (Q, u, v)$
* $p({p_x}, {p_y}) \to p^*: v = {p_x} u - {p_y}$
* $\ell: y = kx + n \to \ell^*(k, -n)$

### Exercise 1

Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in a plane. A point $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$, not necessarily from $P$, is a *central point* for $P$ if the following holds: every half-plane containing $x$ contains at least $n/3$ points of $P$.

1. What does this mean in the dual space?
2. Describe an algorithm which finds a central point if it exists.

Algorithm:
* determine the lines dual to the points of $P$ ($O(n)$)
* perform a sweep-line algorithm to determine the paths bounding the upper and lower $n/3$ of the lines ($O(n^2 \log n)$)
* compute the lower hull of the upper path and the upper hull of the lower path ($O(n)$)
* if the hulls do not intersect, then we can draw a line $x^*$ between them which is dual to a central point $x$ ($O(n)$)
* if the hulls intersect, then there is no central point

### Exercise 2

Let $S$ be a set of $n$ segments in a plane.

1. Describe an algorithm which decides in $O(n^2)$ time whether there exists a line intersecting every segment of $S$.
2. Describe an algorithm which returns a line intersecting the largest number of segments of $S$.

Algorithm:
* determine the dual wedges of the segments
* perform a sweep-line algorithm maintaining the order of the lines bounding the wedges and the number of wedges each interval between the lines belongs to
* if we find an interval contained in $n$ wedges, then a point in it is the dual of a line intersecting all segments of $S$
* we can remember the interval contained in the largest number of wedges to determine the line intersecting the largest number of segments

Time complexity: $O(n^2 \log n)$

## Voronoi diagrams

Voronoi diagram of a set $P$ of points in a plane (*sites*): subdivision of the plane into cells according to the closest point of $P$

---

### Exercise 3

Construct the Voronoi diagram of the points $(0, 0), (3, 2), (1, 5), (4, 4), (5, 8), (6, 1)$.

---

### Exercise 4

Construct the Voronoi diagram of the points $(0, 1), (2, 2), (4, 5), (6, 3), (1, 9)$ for the ${L_1}$-distance. Write down the coordinates of Voronoi vertices.
