## Duality

### Exercise 1

Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in a plane. A point $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$, not necessarily from $P$, is a *central point* for $P$ if the following holds: every half-plane containing $x$ contains at least $n/3$ points of $P$.

1. What does this mean in the dual space?
2. Describe an algorithm which finds a central point if it exists.

### Exercise 2

Let $S$ be a set of $n$ segments in a plane.

1. Describe an algorithm which decides in $O(n^2)$ time whether there exists a line intersecting every segment of $S$.
2. Describe an algorithm which returns a line intersecting the largest number of segments of $S$.

## Voronoi diagrams

### Exercise 3

Construct the Voronoi diagram of the points $(0, 0), (3, 2), (1, 5), (4, 4), (5, 8), (6, 1)$.

---

### Exercise 4

Construct the Voronoi diagram of the points $(0, 1), (2, 2), (4, 5), (6, 3), (1, 9)$ for the ${L_1}$-distance. Write down the coordinates of Voronoi vertices.
